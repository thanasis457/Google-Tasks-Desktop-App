# Google-Tasks-Desktop-App
## A simple native low-resources desktop app for Google Tasks.

#### This app was created with the intent of creating a local, small, and fast Google Tasks application without the need of using a browser or any 'heavy' application for such a simple app.

To run (you will need python3):
1. ```git clone https://github.com/thanasis457/Google-Tasks-Desktop-App Tasks``` Downloads the files above.
2. ```cd Tasks```
3. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` (Run it with sudo if there are conflicts)
4. ```python3 qt.py```

Let me know of any issues!

Unfortunately I cannot make one-file executables due to issues with Google's Api module
